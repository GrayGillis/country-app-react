# Grayson's Country App - React

Created a web app that brings you the capital city, population, currency, language, and flag from any country that is inputted from the user. The country info is brought in by a web api (REST). The api came from RestCountries.eu.

If the country is spelled incorrectly on input, then the user gets an alert message from the program telling them to make sure the country name is spelled correctly. Once a new country is added, the 'New Country Added!' message appears in red font. There is a 'Country' label above the input field to let the user know that they need to input the Country name in that field.
